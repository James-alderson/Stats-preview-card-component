## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Vendor Prefixes

### What I learned

In this project I learned to used `mix-blend-mode` property. The `mix-blend-mode` CSS property sets how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="card-img">
  <picture>
    <source srcset="assets/images/image-header-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 800px)">
    <img src="assets/images/image-header-mobile.jpg" alt="Enterprise" loading="lazy">
  </picture>
</div>
```
```css
.card-img {
	position: relative;
}
.card-img::after {
	content: "";
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	mix-blend-mode: multiply;
	background-color: var(--Soft-violet);
}
```

### Continued development

Between 600px and 800px width, a simple design was considered for the tablet, to eliminate free space

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - This helped me learn about `mix-blend-mode` property. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
